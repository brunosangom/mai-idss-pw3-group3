Ideas
- Have 2 output neurons and a minimum confidence level. If the max of the 2 outputs is lower than the confidence level, rely only on the prediction of the model-driven component.
- Use AUROC as metric
- Calculate metrics event-wise or onset detection (detecting when fire changes from No to Yes)
