  # Temporal split strategy: controls how data is divided into train/val/test splits
  # Options:
  #   - 'sequential': Original chronological split (first X% -> train, next Y% -> val, rest -> test)
  #                   WARNING: May cause temporal distribution shift if wildfire rates vary over time
  #   - 'month': Assigns entire months to splits in round-robin fashion (balanced across time)
  #   - 'quarter': Assigns entire quarters to splits in round-robin fashion (recommended)
  #   - 'year': Assigns entire years to splits in round-robin fashion (coarsest granularity)
  # The stratified options (month/quarter/year) ensure each split contains data from different
  # time periods, preventing temporal distribution shift while maintaining temporal continuity
  # within each bucket for proper sequence creation.
